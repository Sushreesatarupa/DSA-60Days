## Rules To Contribute To This Repo

-   You can write solutions only in C++ for Data Structure and Algorithms (if you dont know C++ you can submit only algorithm) 
-   Follow file naming convention for all your pull requests.
-   While adding any content it should be inside its appropiate directory
-   if there is any problem with inaccurate solution create an issue!

## file naming convention

 use | file type  |  comments
 ----|------------|---------------
 questions | **README.md**        | all questions of particular topic are mentioned in a `README.md` file inside the sub topic folder 
 C++ solutions | **[topic name].cpp**  | solution C++ codele code to a question is written in same folder where question is mentioned
 algorithm solution | **[topic name]-algorithm.txt** | algorithm solution to a question is written in a `.txt` txt file in same folder where question is mentioned
 technical writing | **[topic name]-content.md** or **[topic name]-content.txt** | technical content can be provided in simple `.txt` text document inside [technical writing folder](https://github.com/Sushreesatarupa/DSA-cpp-Hacktoberfest2021/tree/main/technical%20writings)  you can also style it up and submit a `.md` file if you are aquainted with markdown language
    
## Things you can contribute to 
-   Repo contain folders of all the data structures and algorithms topics with some pre-addressed questions. You can **add a solution** to a question ( present in the readme of particular topic folder) that is unanswered.
-   you can **update existing solution** with a better one ( better complexity).
-   Participants can even **add new questions** and solutions of their interest.
-   There will be a technical writing section in which participants can contribute their **technical writing** on any topic of c++ and data structures.
-   **solve issues** raised by other people or yourself.
-   make webpage ( hosted from GitHub readme ) more appealing and updated.
-   **Well-documented** source code with detailed explanations provides a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
